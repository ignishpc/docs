Getting Started
===============

IgnisHPC is a modularized docker framework consisting of multiple source code repositories. The framework is open source, so all repositories can be found in GitHub: `IgnisHPC <https://github.com/ignishpc>`_.

Next we summarize the minimum steps to execute a simple job in IgnisHPC.

------------
Requirements
------------

As we mentioned, IgnisHPC is a dockerized framework, so all the system modules are executed inside docker containers. On the other hand, IgnisHPC external dependencies such as schedulers or image storage can be installed independently, but IgnisHPC includes a dockerized version of them.

Therefore, the minimum requirements to run Ignis are:

  1. *Docker*: It must be installed and accessible. We recommend using the newest version available.
  2. *Python3*: Available by default in most Linux distributions. It is used to execute a deploy script and simplify the installation of IgnisHPC and its dependencies.
  3. *Pip*: The deploy script is available as a pip package, although it can be downloaded from the source code repository. In any case, using pip is the easiest way to install IgnisHPC.
  4. *Git* (optional): The git binary is required for building IgnisHPC images from repositories.


------------
Installation
------------

IgnisHPC can be installed just using the following command::

 $ pip install ignishpc

Once the command is executed, we can check that we have the ``ignis-deploy`` command available in the path.
This process must be carried out in all the computing nodes where IgnisHPC is going to be executed.


----------------------------
Creating IgnisHPC Containers
----------------------------

Images of IgnisHPC containers are not available for download. They must be built in your runtime environment. This allows the creation of a custom development environment with complete isolation from other framework installations even on the same machines.

In this example we will use a local docker repository and ignishpc as the base path for all images.
::

 $ ignis-deploy registry start --default

| This command will launch a docker repository that will be available on port 5000.
| ``--default`` parameter indicates that other calls to ``ignis-deploy`` should use this repository as the default source.


Once executed, we will receive the following warning message:

.. code-block:: text

    info: add '{insecure-registries" : [ "myhost:5000" ]}' to /etc/docker/daemon.json and restart
           docker daemon service
          use myhost:5000 to refer the registry

The docker registry requires a certificate for validation. We can create one locally or add
``{insecure-registries" : [ "myhost:5000" ]}`` to ``/etc/docker/daemon.json`` with the aim of forcing docker to use an insecure one. Do not forget to restart the docker daemon to reload the configuration.

Once the registration is available, we can proceed with the creation of the IgnisHPC images::

 $ ignis-deploy images build --full --sources \
    https://github.com/ignishpc/dockerfiles.git \
    https://github.com/ignishpc/backend.git \
    https://github.com/ignishpc/core-cpp.git \
    https://github.com/ignishpc/core-python.git

The first two repositories are essential for the construction of the base images. The command can be executed in several phases, it is not necessary to specify all the repositories in the same execution. The only restriction is that if you use the ``--full`` parameter, which creates an extra image with all the core repositories, you must have all the cores together. This allows users to create an image that can run Python and C++ codes in the same container.

-----------------------------
Deploying IgnisHPC Containers
-----------------------------

Once all images are created, it is necessary to deploy the containers. IgnisHPC jobs are launched using the submitter module, but to use a cluster it requires a resource and scheduler manager such as Nomad or Mesos. Next we show three examples deploying the containers locally (no manager is needed), and using Nomad and Mesos. 

Docker (Only local)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Submitter using an http endpoint::

 $ ignis-deploy submitter start --dfs <working-directory-path> --scheduler docker tcp://myhost:2375

Submitter using a Unix-socket::

 $ ignis-deploy submitter start --dfs <working-directory-path> --scheduler docker /var/run/docker.sock \
   --mount /var/run/docker.sock /var/run/docker.sock


Nomad
^^^^^

Master node::

 $ ignis-deploy nomad start --password 1234 --volumes <working-directory-path\*>

Worker nodes::

 $ ignis-deploy nomad start --password 1234 --join myhost1 --default-registry myhost1:5000

Submitter::

 $ ignis-deploy submitter start --dfs <working-directory-path\*> \
    --scheduler nomad http://myhostX:4646


\* The working directory must be available on all nodes via NFS (Network File System) or a DFS (Distributed File System). (Only required for working with files)

Mesos
^^^^^

Zookeeper is requiered by Mesos::

 $ ignis-deploy zookeeper start --password 1234

Master node::

 $ ignis-deploy mesos start -q 1 --name master -zk  zk://master:2281 \
    --service [marathon | singularity] --port-service 8888

Worker nodes::

 $ ignis-deploy mesos start --name nodoX -zk  zk://master:2281 \
    --port-service 8888 --default-registry master:5000

Submitter::

 $ ignis-deploy submitter start --dfs <working-directory-path*> \
    --scheduler [marathon | singularity] http://master:8888


\* The working directory must be available on all nodes via NFS (Network File System) or a DFS (Distributed File System). (Only required for working with files)


-----------------------
Launching the first job
-----------------------

The first step to launch a job is to connect to the submiter container. The default password is ``ignis``, but we can change it inside the container or choose one when launching the submitter.::

 $  ssh root@myhost -p 2222

The code we will use as an example is the classic Wordcount application, which can be seen below.

.. code-block:: python

    #!/usr/bin/python

    import ignis

    # Initialization of the framework
    ignis.Ignis.start()
    # Resources/Configuration of the cluster
    prop = ignis.IProperties()
    prop["ignis.executor.image"] = "ignishpc/python"
    prop["ignis.executor.instances"] = "1"
    prop["ignis.executor.cores"] = "2"
    prop["ignis.executor.memory"] = "1GB"
    # Construction of the cluster
    cluster = ignis.ICluster(prop)

    # Initialization of a Python Worker in the cluster
    worker = ignis.IWorker(cluster, "python")
    # Task 1 - Tokenize text into pairs ('word', 1)
    text =  worker.textFile("text.txt")
    words = text.flatmap(lambda line: [(word, 1) for word in line.split()])
    # Task 2 - Reduce pairs with same word and obtain totals
    count = words.reduceBykey(lambda a, b: a + b)
    # Print results to file
    count.saveAsTextFile("wordcount.txt")

    # Stop the framework
    ignis.Ignis.stop()


In order to run it, we need to create a file containing a text sample (``text.txt``) and store it in the working
directory. By default the submitter sets the working directory to ``/media/dfs``. All relative paths used in the
source code are resolved using this working directory, so ``/media/dfs/text.txt`` is an alias of ``text.txt``.

Finally, we can execute our code using the submitter::

 $ ignis-submit ignishpc/python python3 driver.py

or::

  $ ignis-submit ignishpc/python ./driver.py


When the execution has finished, we can see the result of the execution in ``wordcount.txt`` located in the working directory. If we want to check the execution logs, we must navigate to the scheduler web or use ``docker log`` in case of using docker directly.
